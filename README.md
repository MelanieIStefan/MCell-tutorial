- Calcium enters the cell through activated NMDA receptors
- Calcium activates CaMKII 
- Activated CaMKII enzymatically activates AMPA receptors

**To do**: Expand on the biology


# Getting started with MCell and CellBlender

This tutorial will assume you have MCell and CellBlender already installed.

**To do**: Link to installation instructions on MCell pages

# Calcium binding to CaMKII

Open Blender. In Blender, open the file
